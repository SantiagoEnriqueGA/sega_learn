class ARIMA:
    """ARIMA model for time series forecasting.

    ARIMA is a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values,
    its own past forecast errors, and a number of lagged forecast errors.
    It is a combination of Auto-Regressive (AR), Moving Average (MA) models, and differencing (I) to make the series stationary.

    The model is defined by three parameters: p, d, and q, which represent the order of the AR,
    the degree of differencing, and the order of the MA components, respectively.

    Attributes:
        order (tuple): The order of the ARIMA model (p, d, q).
        p (int): The order of the Auto-Regressive (AR) component.
        d (int): The degree of differencing.
        q (int): The order of the Moving Average (MA) component.
        model (array-like): The original time series data used for fitting.
        fitted_model (dict): The fitted ARIMA model containing AR and MA coefficients.
        _differenced_series (array-like): The differenced series used for fitting ARMA.
        _residuals (array-like): The residuals after fitting the AR component.
