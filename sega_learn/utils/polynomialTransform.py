    This class implements Polynomial Feature Transformation.
    Polynomial feature transformation is a technique used to create new features from the existing features by raising them to a power or by creating interaction terms.
    
    Parameters:
    - degree: int, default=2
        The degree of the polynomial features.
        
    Attributes:
    - n_samples: int
        The number of samples.
    - n_features: int
        The number of features.
    - n_output_features: int
        The number of output features.
    - combinations: list of tuples of shape (n_features,)
        The combinations of features(X) of degree n.
    - bias: bool, default=True
        Whether to include a bias term in the output features.
